Go interpreter.

_Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!_

This is the worst software in the world. Do not use for any purpose,
ever. I am writing it with the following objectives in mind:

* gain a more profound understanding of the Go language itself
* master the `reflect` package
* do a challenging exercise in tree traversal
* have fun

The following are non-objectives for this project:

* performance
* real-world applicability
